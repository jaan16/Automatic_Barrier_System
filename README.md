# Automatic_Barrier_System

A five-foot-tall facial recognition-based automatic barrier system was designed and prototyped for the project utilizing the Arduino IDE, C++, Arduino UNO, ESP32 CAM Module, NEMA 23HS stepper motor, LCD display, SMPS, and ultrasonic sensor. Learning how to interface stepper motors, create mechanical systems, and choose materials and power sources were all part of the project.
